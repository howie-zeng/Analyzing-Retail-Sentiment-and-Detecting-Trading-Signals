"24% profit, Day 1 of 30 - $1k to $1M challenge",679,1858h09,wallstreetbets,https://i.redd.it/hespf2fkex2c1.png,157,"First Trade of the 30 Trade challenge - SPX 4555P 0 DTE.. +24%.

I was going for a quick intraday setup and I saw that the indexes were selling randomly and aggressively. I expected a move back through 4350 and bought right when it crossed through this level.

I wanted to short IWM but when the market opened it seemed too oversold (wrong), but then I saw a good spot to go long SPX. I did and started moving my stops up as it went green.

Not much to say about the first Trade of the 30 trade challenge. Juat needed a good start and a win. Got it. Now time to identify setups for bigger trades and maybe some swing trades with QQQ and tech names. 

On a side note red is making an extremely difficult to post anything so I'll have to figure out what the moderators what's going on.",1701106353.0
