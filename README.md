### [Date: 10/02/2023]
#### Progress
- Successfully extracted stock data from Yahoo Finance, focusing on popular meme stocks like GME, AMC, and BB.
- Initiated exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify general trends and patterns within the extracted stock data, such as price fluctuations and trading volumes during specific time frames.

#### Challenges
- Encountered API rate limits while extracting data, which hindered the efficiency of the data retrieval process.
- Realized that searching and utilizing available datasets might be a more efficient approach compared to real-time API data extraction due to the aforementioned rate limits.

#### Next Steps
- Seek datasets containing Reddit and Twitter posts/comments related to the identified meme stocks.
- Develop a strategy to clean and merge these datasets in a manner that facilitates subsequent analysis.

#### To-Dos
- Conduct a thorough EDA on the extracted stock data, focusing on identifying potential correlations with expected social media sentiment trends.
- Identify and acquire datasets containing social media posts and comments related to the meme stocks.
- Develop a strategy for cleaning and preprocessing the social media data, ensuring it is in a usable format for sentiment analysis.

### [Date: MM/DD/YYYY]
#### Progress
- Completed EDA, identifying key trends such as the most frequently discussed stocks and general sentiment direction (positive/negative) in the stock data.
- Trained an initial sentiment analysis model using a small subset of manually labeled data, achieving an accuracy of XX%.

#### Challenges
- The sentiment analysis model demonstrated lower accuracy than desired, potentially due to the limited size and quality of the training data.
- Ensuring accurate interpretation of financial jargon and slang from forums like WallStreetBets by the sentiment analysis model.

#### Next Steps
- Enhance the sentiment analysis model by incorporating additional training data and exploring the utilization of pre-trained models.
- Begin aligning sentiment data with stock price movements to identify preliminary correlations and potential predictive patterns.

#### To-Dos
- Expand the training data for the sentiment analysis model, ensuring a diverse range of sentiments and jargon are included.
- Explore the use of pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for sentiment analysis to potentially improve accuracy and understanding of financial jargon.
- Extract and align stock price data for the identified meme stocks with the sentiment data.
- Begin preliminary analysis to identify correlations between sentiment and stock price movements, focusing on identifying any lag or lead patterns in the data.
